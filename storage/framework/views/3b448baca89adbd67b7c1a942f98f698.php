                        Perhaps it was just fitting that the main guest of honor at the Riviera Golf Club opening of the
                        Riviera Golf Club driving range is a huge part of modern Philippine history: Fidel V. Ramos, former
                        president of the republic, and one of the icons of the 1986 EDSA Revolution. <br>
                        <br>
                        Perhaps it was doubly fitting that the event took place in a place of unassailable history
                        itself-Cavite, home to numerous heroes of the 1898 Philippine Revolution. That’s because the day,
                        August 17, 1997, ushered in a revolution in Philippine golf courses in that a truly championship
                        course—the best in Asia then, for sure—was inaugurated. <br>
                        <br>
                    <p>Fidel V. Ramos, the sitting president during the 1990s, frequented Riviera for a friendly round of
                        golf with government officials and high-ranking AFP officers.</p>

                        Two years before the new millennium, Riveira launched two major tournaments: the Club Championship
                        Finals in November 1998 at the Challenging Langer Course and the 4-ball Scramble Championship
                        qualifiers at the Couples Course in December. <br>
                        <br>In July 1999, Riviera hosted the final qualifying round for the Philip Morris Golf Classic. The
                        Club was also selected as the venue for the Professional and Amateur National Finals held in August
                        1999. <br>
                        <br>The Philip Morris Golf Classic Final leg champions were then-Club president Danny Pizarro
                        (Seniors) and Grace Atienza (Ladies B). Felix “Cassius” Casas was named Tournament of Champions
                        grand-slam winner and bagged a cash prize of P150,000.

                <p class="con3_p1">
                    Also in 1999, two major tournaments became anticipated events in Riviera: The Invitational, where
                    members and guests participate; and the Year-end Tournaments, also known as the Family Tournament.
                </p>

                <p class="con3_p1">
                    The first Invitational was held in May 1999. Ninety-four players participated in this two-day event.
                    Day One was a team-aggregate competition using Stableford points. A cocktail party was held and
                    featured a Calcutta Draw wherein bets were placed on a team’s second-day performance and the pool
                    rose to P26,000.
                </p>

                <p class="con3_p1">
                    The second day of the First Riviera Invitational was held at the Langer Course in a one-ball,
                    two-some format. The results of the tournament were announced during a dinner party where a Toyota
                    Rav 4 was raffled off as the grand prize.
                </p>

                <p class="con3_p1 mb-0">
                    Virgilio de Silva and Oca Saldivar were declared Class A champions. Wilson Uy won a round-trip
                    ticket to San Francisco, USA, for a hole-in-one at #14 Couples, while Norton Gonzalez won a Toyota
                    Corolla for a hole-in-one at #17 Langer. <br>
                    <br>Virgilio de Silva and Oca Saldivar were declared the First
                    Riviera Invitational Class A Champions. Wilson Uy won a round-trip ticket to San Francisco, USA, for a
                    hole-in-one at #14 Couples while Norton Gonzalez a Toyota Corolla won for a hole-in-one at #17 Langer.

                    “This Even is now firmly placed as the highlight of the Riviera golfing calendar due to its mixture of
                    fun, competition, entertainment, and camaraderie,” John Blanch, the general manager then, had said about
                    the invitational. To note, no less than Sen. Tito Sotto participated in the 2nd invitational in 2000,
                    which saw 102 teams competing, and he was declared Class A champion with Ulay Garcia as teammate. <br>

                    <br>It was also in December that year that the Family Tournament held to usher in the new millennium.
                    Antonio, Christian, and Carlo Catoco, and Ambrosio de Luna were declared champions for the First Riviera
                    Family Scramble. That year, Riviera launched its junior Golf tourneys with a clinic. <br>

                    <br>By 2000, the Langer Course had become the venue for the Philippine Open, the oldest National Open
                    Golf Tournament in Asia and, therefore, the most prestigious. The event, organized by the National Golf
                    Association of the Philippines, was sanctioned by the Asian Professional Golf Association. It featured
                    top players from the Davidoff Tour as well as leading amateurs and professionals from the Philippines.
                    <br>

                    <br>That tournament made Riviera the first club in the country “to host the Open over both courses [the
                    Couples Course was played over in the 1998 Open] that can really boast having two championship courses!”
                    Blanch wrote in 2000.
